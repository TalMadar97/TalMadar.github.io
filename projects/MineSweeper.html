        Welcome to Minesweeper! Try to clear the grid without clicking on a
        mine.
      </p>
      <p><strong>How to Play:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Click on a cell to reveal what's underneath.</li>
        <li>
          If it's a number, it shows how many mines are adjacent to that cell.
        </li>
        <li>
          If it's a blank space, it means no adjacent mines, and surrounding
          cells will be revealed.
        </li>
        <li>If you click on a mine, the game is over.</li>
        <li>
          You can flag cells where you think there might be a mine by
          right-clicking.
        </li>
      </ul>
